When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


```{r}
library(tseries)
data("AirPassengers")
class(AirPassengers)
start(AirPassengers)
AirPassengers
end(AirPassengers)
```
```{r}
frequency(AirPassengers)
summary(AirPassengers)
plot(AirPassengers)
abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)),col="red")
cycle(AirPassengers)
plot(aggregate(AirPassengers,FUN=mean))
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers))
```
```{r}
summary(AirPassengers)
plot(AirPassengers)
```
```{r}
adf.test(diff(log(AirPassengers)), alternative="stationary", k=0)
acf(log(AirPassengers))
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```
```{r}
pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
(fit <- arima(log(AirPassengers), c(0, 1, 1),seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 12)))
pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
```
```{r}
pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
ts.plot(AirPassengers,2.718^pred$pred, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
```
